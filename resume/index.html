        <p>
          I am an experienced Solutions Architect and Cloud Professional with a
          passion for being hands on with projects through the entire software
          lifecycle. My history includes the development and delivery of voice
          applications, embedded systems, and complex enterprise web
          applications in a high transaction volume, high availability
          environments. I take pride in getting things done and doing them

        </h3>
        <p class="cozy">
          Senior Solutions Architect on the Alexa Smart Properties team.
          Management of the Hospitality Domain was my primary responsibilities
          in this role. I worked directly with several high profile hotel,
          resort, and vacation rental partners; pitching new Alexa features,
          providing advice and assistance during development, and guiding their
          skills through certification.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was the subject matter expert on the Solutions Architecture team for
          our development of a BYOC (Bring Your Own Content) solution for our
          enterprise customers on the new generative AI powered Alexa+ service.
          This feature allows partners to supply their own content and branding
          to Enterprise Alexa+ as simply as providing text/pdf files or website
          content. Files are then pushed into an OpenSearch instance on AWS and
          referenced by Alexa+ when generating responses via Retrieval-Augmented
          Generation (RAG). In this role I worked between our product team and
          our partners to gather requirements, build prototypes, and educate
          partners on capabilities and limitations of the technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Received the Alexa Solutions Architect of the month for resolving a
          highly complex technical issue at a prestigious Las Vegas Resort that
          had turned the relationship with the partner contentious. This debug
          took more than a month, required a couple of site visits, and involved
          many different teams within Alexa to help root cause. I demonstrated
          excellent technical skills and partner management skills in this
          episode, with the partner explicitly acknowledging that this
          resolution has increased their trust in the Alexa Smart Properties
          solution, and confirmed that the issue has de-escalated from the
          Property President.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this role I also wrote Alexa skills and sample code that were then
          open sourced on Github, wrote integrations with partner systems to
          accelerate launch timelines, wrote reusable automation scripts to help
          partners interact with our API, helped the QA team reproduce partner
          issues, and worked with our prduct team to help identify and source
          partner candidates for beta testing new and improved features.

          Senior Solutions Architect •

        </h3>
        <p class="cozy">
          Senior Solutions Architect on the Alexa Smart Home team. Management of
          the robotic vacuum, kitchen, and small appliance domains are my
          primary responsibilities in this role. I work directly with several
          high profile partners; pitching new Alexa features, providing advice
          and assistance during development, and guiding their skills through
          certification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fostered relationships with key stakeholders and leadership on both
          internal and external product teams to help disambiguate product plans
          and keep key partners engaged and committed during the launch of
          Announcements and Hunches, two new features in the robotic vacuum
          domain. Announcement allow a device to have Alexa proactively notify a
          customer that it needs attention and Hunches enables Alexa to
          automatically instruct a robotic vacuum to clean when it is detected
          that a customer isn’t home. Both projects suffered from repeated
          delays which were both a source of frustration and a major challenge
          for our partners. I was able to maintain trust with our partners
          through honesty and clarity around schedule, advised them on methods
          to decouple the feature from ongoing software releases, and provided
          clear guidance on required late breaking changes. Both features
          successfully launched in Q3 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
          Demonstrated ability to influence product roadmaps and advocate on
          behalf of partners when I coordinated with the Smart Home product team
          and convinced them to fund a native voice experience for robotic
          vacuum APIs in 2022. Prior to this each robotic vacuum partner
          developed their own custom experience. I was the co-author of the
          proposal and provided data and metrics around failed utterances,
          customer attrition, and negative customer skill reviews. Additional
          evidence was provided in the form of existing partner feedback and
          lost partner opportunities due to the lack of a proper Smart Home API.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to new feature launches I also drive improvements with
          existing skill integrations by optimizing partner architectures to
          improve customer impacting metrics like skill/device latency, device
          state accuracy, device control success rate, and utterances with user
          perceived defects.

          the stack; firmware code, connectivity debugging, Alexa skills
          development, and the optimization of those skills in AWS Lambda. Once
          technically sound I successfully guided our partners though a

          our trivia skill sample to provide for a ‘better with buttons’
          experience to allow engagement with both customers who had Echo
          Buttons and those who did not. The games that launched utilizing this

          best practices for each. Skill code was provided in both Javascript
          and Python for each sample as to allow developers to use the language
          that they were most comfortable with. The release of these skills
          helped to raise awareness and adoption of Alexa Gadgets and Echo
          Buttons.

          Technically focused Program Manager on the Sales and Marketing
          Operations team for Amazon Payments. In this role, my primary
          responsibility was to design, build, and manage a variety of software
          applications that help increase the productivity of our Sales and

          in our business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Designed and built from scratch a web application that collects and
          analyzes data from a variety of sources (internal financial
          information, Salesforce, internal/external web metrics, web scraping,
          etc.) to provide a more complete understanding of a website and its
          suitability for engagement by our marketing and sales teams.
          Additionally, it provides a business at a glance view utilized by
          Account Management and Compliance Monitoring teams for help
          determining the attrition risk and acceptable use policy violations of
          existing merchants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Created an application to bridge the gap between our merchant
          registration system and our 3rd party customer relationship management
          system. This allows our salespeople to see new registrations in near
          real time instead of waiting 24 hours or more as was the case previous
          to this application. The application also collects merchant
          information related to the registrations from several internal systems
          to ensure the salesperson has the information they need to take action
          once a merchant has been assigned to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also managed our 3rd party customer relationship management and
          marketing automation systems as well as a variety of smaller

          those systems.
