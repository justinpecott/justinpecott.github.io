          Here is everything I've posted, to this moment at least. I'll likely
          be adding more backfills as I work through all my photos.

                  alt="Justin and Pam stand embracing on a sandy beach at dusk, with fishing boats or small watercraft visible behind them on the shore. Justin wears a light-colored shirt with dark shorts, while the Pam wears a white and black striped dress or outfit. The scene is illuminated by twilight with a blue-gray sky, and what appears to be wooden pilings or a dock structure can be seen extending into the water. Soft lighting highlights the sand and boats, creating a warm evening beach atmosphere with some distant lights visible across the water."

                  alt="A silhouette of a Pam walking a Olive on a leash along a beach at sunset or sunrise. The Pam and Olive are dark silhouettes against a colorful sky, with the sun visible just above the horizon, creating orange and golden hues that blend into blue. The beach appears wide and flat with smooth, damp sand that reflects some of the light from the sky. The ocean is visible in the background with gentle waves, and a layer of clouds stretches across the horizon. The scene conveys a peaceful, contemplative moment of a solitary walk along the shoreline during the golden hour, with long shadows stretching across the sand. The contrast between the dark figures and the vibrant sky creates a striking visual composition."

                  alt="A serene forest trail winding through tall evergreen trees. The path is covered with brown dirt and scattered with fallen leaves. Dense greenery including ferns and shrubs line both sides of the trail. In the middle of the path stands Olive, a small liver and tan English Cocker Spaniel, looking back toward the camera. The forest has a lush, peaceful atmosphere with filtered light coming through the conifer canopy, creating a classic Pacific Northwest woodland scene. Fallen logs can be seen on the left side of the trail, and the path curves gently into the distance, disappearing among the trees."

                  alt="Justin is relaxing in a small fishing boat on calm water on a river in Jamaica. He's lying back on cushioned boat seats with his legs stretched out, appearing to be napping or resting. The boat has an outboard motor and is surrounded by lush green vegetation reflecting in the still water. The scene captures a peaceful moment of leisure."

A coconut palm tree frames the scene to the left, with the ocean visible in the background during what appears to be sunset or early evening. The setting conveys a peaceful tropical vacation atmosphere with golden hour lighting across the shoreline."

                  alt="Two silhouetted people - Justin and Pam - walking along a vast, reflective beach at low tide. They are accompanied by two dogs - Olive and Dylan - one dog is walking near each person. The scene has a moody, atmospheric quality with cloudy, gray skies creating a dramatic backdrop. The wet sand perfectly mirrors the figures and the diffused light from the sky, creating striking reflections. In the distance, there appears to be a forested shoreline or hills shrouded in mist. Light breaks through the clouds on the right side of the image, causing some brightness on the water's surface. The overall color palette is dominated by shades of gray and silver, giving the scene a serene, contemplative mood. The beach appears largely empty except for these figures, suggesting a peaceful, solitary walk along the shoreline."

The building behind them has a sign that reads 'TearDrops NW' with the tagline 'It's Still Camping!' The compact trailer features black wheels, a rear hatch, and appears designed for outdoor adventures."

The group includes members of Justin and Pam's families. Olive stands with them on the left - barking at the drone taking the photo, while Nate playfully holds a Layla overhead. Despite the overcast sky, the group displays animated, playful poses and expressions, creating a joyful atmosphere during what seems to be a casual outdoor gathering."

                  alt="Justin crouching on a large piece of driftwood on a sandy beach. He is holding Olive, a small live and tan English Cocker Spaniel. Justin is wearing sunglasses, a light gray top, and blue jeans. The setting is a wide, open beach with wet sand, and the ocean is visible in the background with small waves breaking on the shore. The sky is mostly blue with some white clouds scattered throughout. The driftwood appears to be a large weathered log or tree trunk washed up on the beach. The scene depicts a clear, pleasant day at the beach, with the Justin and Olive positioned atop the natural wooden landmark."
