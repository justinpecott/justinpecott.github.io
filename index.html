        <h3>Hello, my name is Justin</h3>
        <p>
          I like to think of myself as a pretty honest and unassuming guy, just
          trying to do the best I can with the time I have. In my day job I help
          people make computers do things. Sometimes the computers are big,
          sometimes they’re small, and sometimes they talk. Outside of work I
          enjoy running, drinking pints of tasty craft beer, and of course
          spending time with friends and family. I want to spend more time
          hiking and fishing - trying to fix that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Michigan raised, and a Midwesterner to the core, but I've called the
          Pacific Northwest home for a good long while now. At present that
          means Tacoma, WA. I believe this is the best city the PNW has to offer
          and if you disagree you're wrong!

He's lying back on cushioned boat seats with his legs stretched out, appearing to be napping or resting. The boat has an outboard motor and is surrounded by lush green vegetation reflecting in the still water. The scene captures a peaceful moment of leisure."
