# My Personal Site on the Web

Jekyll, Hugo, or some other site generator? Nah, let's get crazy - radically simple... Hand crafted HTML and CSS!

## Resources that guided me along the way...

Since we're deploying on GitHub Pages; Simon Willison's [GitHub Pages: The Missing Manual](https://til.simonwillison.net/github/github-pages) was very valuable.

I'm a RSS junkie so needed to have a feed. Nice post on [Hand writing your rss feed](https://everest-pipkin.com/teaching/handmadeRSS).

I have a font awesome pro license so that's where I grabbed all the icons from. Using raw svg rather than hosting with them. Perhaps not sexy but easy and solid. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons).

The dark art of Favicons...

## Photo Resolutions

Based on a quick swag of resizing images I went with 1200x1600 for index.html and individual pages. The archive page gets 450x600.

### Photo Sizes

- Original (3024x4032) -> 3.4 MB
- 1200x1600 60% Trim Edges -> 437 KB (Looks great)
- 600x800 60% Trim Edges -> 124 KB
- 450x600 60% Trim Edges -> 74 KB
