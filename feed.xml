				  Another incredible trip to Jamaica. And what a nice relaxing trip up
				  the Black River as you can see. There was just one problem - this is
				  the moment I got
				  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever">dengue fever</a>.
				  It would be a long couple weeks for me once we got home.

				  Jamaica. He's lying back on cushioned boat seats with his legs
				  stretched out, appearing to be napping or resting. The boat has an
				  outboard motor and is surrounded by lush green vegetation reflecting
				  in the still water. The scene captures a peaceful moment of leisure."

				  The battle tank has been acquired! Looks a little more beastly than
				  we'll need for trips to the
				  <a href="https://parks.wa.gov/">State Park</a> but it's nicely
				  appointed! Thank you to
				  <a href="https://www.teardropsnw.com/">Teardrops NW</a>!

The building behind them has a sign that reads 'TearDrops NW' with the tagline 'It's Still Camping!' The compact trailer features black wheels, a rear hatch, and appears designed for outdoor adventures."
